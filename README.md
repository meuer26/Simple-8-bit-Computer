# 8-bit-Simulator

This computer is a Von Neumann architecture and a RISC machine. This computer's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) only has 10 implemented opcodes and yet it possesses the primary characteristics for Turing Completeness: (1) the ability to read and modify memory, (2) the ability to branch for program control (including conditional branching), and (3) the ability to do arithmetic operations
